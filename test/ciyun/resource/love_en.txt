When I die
please don't be sad
It'll hurt me
l will come to you like the wind
Wipe your tear 
kiss your cheeks
I'll whisper a poem in your ear
I'll relive the stories of our youth with you

When l die
My love，please don't be afraid
My body will turn into a tree trunk
My arms will turn into branches
When the storm comes ，I will shelter you from the wind and rain

My love ，when I die 
I'll still keep our promise
I'll join the earth
when spring comes back to the earth
You'll hear my heart beat
Like when we were so youny
You buried your head in my chest
My love，after I die
